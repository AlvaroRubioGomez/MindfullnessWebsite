            <p>"On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled 
            and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot 
            foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail 
            in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil 
            and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our 
            power of choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like 
            best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances 
            and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that 
            pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds 
            in these matters to this principle of selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater 
            pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."</p>
